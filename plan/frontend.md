# Frontend

## Template 

The `thinker` web-app will be built using a minimal NextJS app that is deployed to Vercel. 

Requirements:
- Use the project found at `/Users/sprasad/workplace/sample-frontend` as an example, but do not mimic any project-specific context/information from that project. 
- Replicate only file organization and deployment structure but leave concrete components such as the page content empty. 
- Just like the sample project, no authorization or authentication is necessary through an accompanying database like Supabase.
- Make the page title `thinker`.
- Use the colors in this palette as the color scheme: https://coolors.co/palette/01161e-124559-598392-aec3b0-eff6e0
  - I want to use #01161E as the dark mode colour, and #EFF6E0 as the light mode colour.
  - The website header should contain the logo found at `frontend/images/logo.png` followed by the bolded text: `thinker`.

## Landing Page

The landing page should be simple and mostly empty. 

Requirements:
- It should contain the centered text: "Do you remember life without AI? When we used to think for ourselves".
- Then, it should be followed by the button "Start thinking".
