# thinker

An app that features short anti-brainrot programming puzzles.

## Motivation

> Do you remember life without AI? When we used to think for ourselves? 

As we increasingly leverage AI in software development, we spend less time thinking about the details of what we create and focus more on the higher picture. Gone are the days of agonizing over bugs and recalling language syntax. While this has removed a lot of the more unpleasant parts of development, this has also led to our brains focusing less on lower-level implementation details. We just don't see that as important anymore.

### The Google Effect

This is reiminiscent of the [*2011 Google Effect study*](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1207745), where those that depended on Google as "external memory" were prone to "digital amnesia". Brains were being rewired to remember how to locate information rather than preserve what that information is.

Growing up, I remember transitioning from the era of looking up words using a physical dictionary to using Google extensively for the same purpose. Removing that extra step of indirection felt magical (almost like cheating), and it feels impossible to go back to the way things were.

### Is the AI Effect different?

Ok, so who cares? The jump from manual information access to Google is probably the same as manual content generation to using AI. This is just a natural step towards our no-work AI-centric utiopian society, right? Honestly, it's a bit too early to tell but recent research has pointed to AI-inspired cognitive offloading causing reduced problem-solving, decision-making, and critical thinking abilities. The effect is more pronounced in younger generations than in older ones. A society that thinks critically less is one that makes less informed choices, which has a bunch of negative cascading effects.

`thinker` is an attempt to counteract that trend by offering access to some small self-contained programming puzzles. These puzzles require you to think deeply at a micro scale, and are intended to be solved without AI assistance. If nothing else, they also serve as a time-machine, reminding you of how annoying things used to be :)
